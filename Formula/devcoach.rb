  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      Connect your agents with:  devcoach install
      devcoach registers hooks, an MCP server and a skill in your agents' config files.
      Homebrew cannot undo that on brew uninstall (formulae have no uninstall hook), so
      before uninstalling run:
        devcoach uninstall            # Claude Code + Claude Desktop (--all: also Gemini/Codex)
        devcoach uninstall --data     # also delete ~/.devcoach (lessons, profile, notebook)
    EOS
  end

  test do
    assert_match "devcoach", shell_output("#{bin}/devcoach --version")
  end
end
